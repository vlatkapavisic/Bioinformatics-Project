The program takes two or three strings as arguments and they represent the paths of the input (the first two)
and output (the third one, if given) files. All input files should be written in the FASTA format.

The program doesn't write anything in the console by default except the number of nanoseconds it took to 
align the two sequences. If the user wants the program to write the alignment in the console, he has to add
only two arguments when running the program and when asked to write the path of the output file in the console, 
he should just press ENTER.
